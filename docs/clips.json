So we look at next slide, slide nine. So this is the probability of contango by underlying APY quartile. So again, we assign a percentile ranking to the underlying yield observations, then figure out, you know, how frequently do we observe contango in that quartile in that quartile? You can see contango is overrepresented in low yield regimes on the left tail of the underlying yield distribution. And then inversely on the next slide, how frequently do we observe steep backwardation? So term spread less than arbitrarily negative 5%. Steep backwardation is overrepresented in the right tail of the underlying yield distribution. When the underlying yield is above its 75th percentile. In every single observation where the underlying yield has been above its 90th percentile, we see steep backwardation in 100% of those observations. So what this suggests is basically the front month pricing on the on the term structure, that's going to fluctuate the most with the current market conditions. But the back month pricing is",

But I can't go to Starbucks and buy coffee with stable coin and and you know I can buy Bitcoin with it but I can't buy coffee.
