Maybe you want to go into a particular vertical and emphasize the one that's the most important. But whatever your strength as an individual. The thing about AI is it's a thinking partner. You have to build a relationship with it. And if you do, it's customized to you as opposed to it being a software button where you're pressing a button and it's doing the exact same thing which in most cases is not what you actually want. It's what the system can do. >> I forget the name of the company. Sequoia just invested, I think, for the second or third time in it. And they said that at the board meetings. U this company uh taps into all of your business systems and then uh it's kind of like an overlay. You can talk to it. Uh, and they said at the board meetings for the company, they just keep asking the model what to do. And so they were like, you know, like dog fooding their own product. And I I sat there and I was",

Namik, I'll start with you. >> Yeah, I mean thanks for the question, David. I I think it was honestly a validation of our point of view for a while. Uh we're called Mega E. We love Ethereum. Um I mean I got into crypto because of E. So it has a a special place in my heart. But the reason why Mega uses Ethereum is not because of like you know fanboyism but because it allowed us to build the most performant possible blockchain, right? So um",
