Yeah, well, I think 2026 is going to be a really interesting year for crypto. I think it's going to be a breakout year for crypto to finally, finally emerge from just sort of like the pure speculative side of things, the pure kind of like hyper gambling, if you will, and really, really be the year where we start to fulfill, in my mind, a lot of the initial vision around crypto, which is peer to peer electronic cash.",

So let's talk about Phantom, right? I mean, Phantom was the first wallet that I used where I said, this is what I think crypto user experience should be like. Because I felt like previous iterations of wallets or just applications that were very clunky, right? And then Phantom felt very intuitive. And of course, you guys started as a solana first wallet right uh and that's where i that's where i i joined on that journey as well but then i was really excited to see you guys start adding multi-chains right uh you guys have eth obviously sweeze on on there so many different things so i want to kind of ask you about what is like what's that core what's the core problem essentially you guys are trying to solve for for that crypto space well yeah i mean i think the problem that we're trying to solve for the crypto",
