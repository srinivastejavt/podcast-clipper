A big moment uh to say the least. uh when you guys saw this tweet rocker rocket around Twitter, it got it got so big that basically everyone on crypto Twitter was commenting on this uh what was your reaction to it? Namik, I'll start with you. >> Yeah, I mean thanks for the question, David. I I think it was honestly a validation of our point of view for a while. Uh we're called Mega E. We love Ethereum. Um I mean I got into crypto because of E. So it has a a special place in my heart. But the reason why Mega uses Ethereum is not because of like you know fanboyism but because it allowed us to build the most performant possible blockchain, right? So um",

      "full_post_text": "\"ethereum's success is its biggest challenge\"\n\nhere's what i understood + my take - namik from mega e was validating their point of view on using ethereum for performance. but let's dig deeper, this means that ethereum's current success might be limiting its potential growth in the future.\n\ni think this highlights the challenges of scaling a widely-used blockchain like ethereum, and how it may struggle to innovate and adapt quickly enough to meet growing demands. this is connected to the broader trend of layer 2 solutions trying to alleviate these scalability issues.\n\nbut what most people miss is that ethereum's success might also be creating a self-reinforcing cycle where its own growth becomes a bottleneck for further development, making it harder for new ideas and projects to emerge.",

The the problem we've always had with stable coins is we've not had utility with them, right? But I can't go to Starbucks and buy coffee with stable coin and and you know I can buy Bitcoin with it but I can't buy coffee. What's going to happen with the Genius Act is I think Chase and some of the other very large banks are going to build rails that will work on coin. That will mean that I now have utility.
